# @ue-shed/uasset-win32-x64

## 0.13.0

## 0.12.0

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f01e74: Add the opt-in uasset-io v1.8 package-text extraction operation and public reader stream.
  Each decoded package carries occurrences, complete gap counts and at most three diagnostic
  samples. Preserve the existing extraction stream and add a corpus adapter for package records.

    Negotiate uasset-io v1.9 package flags and gatherable-text summary count/offset in saved headers and Project Index
    header pages. Rebuild disposable Catalog caches for header profile 2. Candidate helpers use
    Unreal's gather flag, non-empty summary and saved external-package relationships; the fixture
    audit proves that TextProperty adds no candidates and every decoded occurrence is retained.

    Add optional corpus coverage for `not_gatherable` packages and exclusion diagnostics, retained
    in bounded localization status reports and Game Text coverage notes, with an optional excluded
    count in validated query summaries. This release also adopts the signature-keyed shared
    package-text layer in CLI and Workbench.

- 67a611c: Saved-world reads now produce contract 2.1, which only adds optional fields. Each actor reports
  `decode` (`partial` when its export or a subobject failed or kept a property value undecoded), its
  saved `parentComponent`, and `heldBy` when a child-actor component that names it in `ChildActor`
  belongs to another saved actor. The result lists every unreadable package or export in
  `packageErrors`, with its category, detail and whether an actor may have been lost, instead of only
  counting them in a diagnostic. Exports that decoded with undecoded property values are summarized in
  one `skipped_property` entry per package, with `count`, `exports` and the most frequent types; they
  do not make the package partial. `uasset saved-world --skipped-properties export` lists one entry
  per export instead. 2.0 documents still decode; consumers that pin `minor: 0` must accept `1`.

    The reader decodes `FIntPoint`, `FColor`, `FLinearColor`, `FBox2D` and `FMatrix` inside arrays,
    sets and maps, where they are always binary. An unknown struct inside a container decodes as a
    tagged stream only when the container's tag proves it; otherwise only its property is skipped, with
    the reason recorded, rather than failing the export or guessing. Landscape heightmap edge-fixup exports, which hold only native binary, are
    skipped instead of reported as failures.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e83f1a: Read saved Game Text from Unreal 4.27 through 5.3 packages that use legacy property tags. The native
  reader and WASM inspection decode legacy tags, containers and text histories alongside the 5.4+
  layout. Text coverage gaps add `legacy_container_element_without_type_information`,
  `feature_unavailable_for_engine_version` and `property_decoder_rejected` reasons beside
  `unsupported_text_history`; consumers that switch exhaustively on the reason should handle them.

## 0.9.3

No direct behavioral change. Align with the UE Shed 0.9.3 suite and exact internal dependency pins.

## 0.9.2

## 0.9.1

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- b8c7623: Add saved Blueprint and Sequencer review through the public reader, CLI, and Workbench:
  typed Level Sequence reads, reference inventory and resolution, and bounded comparisons with
  explicit incomplete evidence. Validate richer Blueprint graphs and regenerated sequences on
  Unreal 5.7 and 5.8. Include native property-bag decoding and saved animation summaries.
- 679d972: Decode boolean container bytes correctly and expose saved bool, integer, byte/enum, and visibility
  channels through Level Sequence schema 5. Preserve omitted defaults, channel flags and enum references;
  extend native/WASM, comparison, and Unreal 5.7/5.8 conformance.
- e5c5811: Expose shared Sequencer settings, scoped camera cuts, binding metadata and saved string/object
  channels through schema 6. Add Blueprint variable declarations, saved CDO overrides and component
  hierarchies/templates through schema 2. Publish bounded contracts and update native/WASM readers,
  reference navigation, comparisons and viewers with independent UE 5.7/5.8 fixture conformance.

    Decode source-checked inherited actor/component native records, including saved construction-script
    member references and conditional scene flags. Expose native evidence separately from tagged
    properties and include it in Blueprint comparisons/navigation and Sequencer reference coverage.

- 3d4c6b1: Decode saved GameplayTagContainer and common math properties through the shared native layouts,
  and expose saved scalar float/double and 3D transform channels through Level Sequence schema 4.
  Each `numeric_channels` entry keeps section-local frame keys, values, interpolation and tangent
  modes, weighted tangents, nullable defaults, extrapolation, tick resolution and ShowCurve; indexed
  paths such as `Translation[0]` preserve axis identity. Missing channels and unsupported sections
  remain explicit coverage gaps. Consumers upgrading from schema 3 must accept the new track kinds
  and required channel arrays.
- 3d4c6b1: Keep saved FText translator notes. Keyed text and StringTable entries saved by UE 5.8 expose
  `dev_notes` in `readSavedAsset` inspection output and compact text extraction, and Game Text
  exposes them on each `TextOccurrence.devNotes`, separate from the source string and localization
  identity. Older packages and empty notes produce `""`. `readSavedTable` text cells are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 8de1090: Export bounded DataTable authoring snapshots from the portable inspection projection through
  `extractAuthoringTable`. Keep native authoring JSON unchanged and compare every authoring fixture
  between the native protocol and WASM. Add the read-only website Data Tables viewer and inspector
  handoff using the shared grid and Patterns components.

## 0.8.0

## 0.7.1

Align this package with the synchronized UE Shed 0.7.1 suite and exact internal dependency pins. There is no direct behavioral change.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Align this unchanged package with the synchronized UE Shed `0.7.0` release. There is no direct behavioral change.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Inspect saved Blueprint graphs without launching Unreal through `readSavedBlueprint`, native IO,
  and the WASM inspection API. Return graph/node identities, saved positions, typed pins and defaults,
  canonical links, tagged node properties, and explicit coverage diagnostics. Inspection is read-only
  and limited to supported uncooked saved revisions; it does not compile or execute Blueprints.

    Improve Project Index discovery, header batching, refresh, and query transport. Bound native
    protocol-worker shutdown and preserve typed reader failures for recovery.

### Patch Changes

- 9d054f5: Use immutable binary Project Index snapshots to improve fresh scans, indexed queries, and cache size.
  Add writer exclusion and interruption recovery checks. Existing catalog caches rebuild on first use.
  Native source builds now require Rust 1.89; SQLite is retained only for opt-in comparison tests.

## 0.5.1

  finite effective transforms, direct root-component attachment evidence, and explicit
